== Exercise: Deploying Applications in a Managed Domain

=== Pre-requisites

* You must have set up a managed domain consisting of a domain controller and 2 host controllers. There must be at least two server groups created each with two servers assigned to them.

* Download the two applications (WAR files) we will deploy in this exercise:

** https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/eap-qc-apps/releases/download/eap8-lp/helloworld.war
** https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/eap-qc-apps/releases/download/eap8-lp/temperature-converter.war

* (Optional) The source code for both of these applications is available at https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/eap-qc-apps/tree/main/apps. To build the WAR files from source:

** Install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org) v3.9 or higher
** Install a Java 17 development environment
** Change to the directory where you cloned the source code for the apps and run `mvn clean package`
** The WAR file is built and will be available under the `target` folder of the application source directory

=== Steps

. Log in to the EAP web console as the `eap-domain-admin` user.

. Click `Deployments` to view the deployments for this domain. This is the place where you can upload application WAR files. You can then assign these uploaded WAR files to one or more server groups in a managed domain.

. Click `Content Repository` in the `Deployments` page. Click the `Add` drop-down in the `Content` column, and then click `Upload Content`.

. In the `Add Content` screen, click on `Choose a file or drag it here` and upload the `helloworld` WAR file you downloaded in the pre-requisites section. Click `Next` and then `Finish`. Once the file is uploaded and you see a `Upload successful` message, click `Close`.

. Repeat the previous step to upload the `temperature-converter.war` file. You should now see two entries in the `Content` column of the `Deployments` page.

. In a managed domain, you always deploy applications to a server group and not to individual servers. You can deploy applications using the web console in two ways. Click on `Content Repository` and select your WAR file in the `Content` column. Expand the `View` drop-down and click `Deploy`. You can also click on `Server Groups`, and then select the group in the `Server Group` column. In the `Deployment` column, click the `Add` button and then select `Upload Deployment`. In both cases, you will see a screen similar to below, where you can select one or more groups to deploy the application.

. For the `helloworld.war`, select the `main-server-group` and click `Deploy`. After some time, you should see a success message indicating that the application was deployed.

. Repeat the above steps and deploy the `temperature-converter.war` application to the `other-server-group`.

. You can now switch to the `Server Groups` view in the `Deployments` page and select the groups in the `Server Group` column to see the applications deployed in the group.

. Click on `Server Groups > main-server-group > helloworld.war` to view the attributes of the deployed application. Recall that you had configured the `main-server-group` to contain `server-one` and `server-three`. These two servers are spread across different hosts for redundancy and fail over. Click on the `/helloworld` link next to `Context Root`, and open it in a new tab

. You should see the output of the `helloworld` application displayed in the web page. It prints some details about the host and port it is running, the current date and the server group.
+

. Now navigate to http://ip_of_eap2:8080/helloworld in a new tab on your browser and observe that the same application should show similar output, but this time it shows a different host and port.
+

. Next, click on `Server Groups > other-server-group > temperature-converter.war`, and then click the link next to `Context Root`. Observe that the port is `8230`, a value that `150` greater than the base port `8080` as per your domain configuration. You should see the temperature converter's input form. Try entering different values and convert between celsius and fahrenheit.
