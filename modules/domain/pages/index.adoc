= JBoss EAP Domain Mode

JBoss EAP 8 can operate in two modes:

[unordered.stack]
Standalone Mode:: Each instance is managed "standalone", that is individually. Each instance has its own web console and unique management credentials.
Domain Mode:: Multiple instances of JBoss EAP, running on the same server or multiple servers, are managed from a central point of control. There is only one web console, from which you can configure and manage the lifecycle of different EAP instances.

This chapter covers setting up JBoss EAP in _Domain Mode_.
