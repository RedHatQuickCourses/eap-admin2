= JBoss EAP Domain Mode Configuration

A JBoss EAP _Managed Domain_ allows you to configure and manage multiple instances of JBoss EAP server from a central point of control.

The diagram below illustrates the components of a JBoss EAP managed domain.

== Terminology and Concepts

It is important to understand the terminology and concepts in a managed domain before creating it.

[unordered.stack]
Managed Domain:: A collection of JBoss EAP instances managed from a central point of control.
Host:: A physical or virtual machine that can run JVM processes.
Host Controller:: A JVM process that runs on each host server that relays configuration information, runtime status, and management commands to JBoss EAP server instances on that particular machine. Host controllers communicate with the _Domain Controller_ and ensures that JBoss EAP server instances are configured as per the policies for a particular domain.
Domain Controller:: The central point from which the domain is controlled. It ensures that each JBoss EAP server is configured according to certain _policies_. The domain controller is a special type of host controller (It is also called the _Primary Host Controller_) that typically does not run JBoss EAP server instances. Instead it runs a small JVM process that communicates with host controllers and manages the configuration policies for the domain.
Server Group:: A collection of JBoss EAP servers that are managed as a _single unit_.
Server:: A JBoss EAP server instance running in its own JVM process. Jakarta EE applications run on servers. In a managed domain, servers are not managed individually, but as part of a _Server Group_.

In the diagram shown above:

* There are `4` hosts (`Host 1, Host 2, Host 3`, and `Host 4`)
* There are `4` host controllers (1 `primary host controller`, and 3 `secondary host controllers`)
* There are `4` JBoss EAP server instances (EAP Server 1-4)
* There are `2` Server Groups (`Server Group A` and `Server Group B`). `Server Group A` consists of `EAP servers 1 and 2`, `Server Group B` contains `EAP servers 3 and 4`.

== Exercise: Configuring a Managed Domain of JBoss EAP Servers

IMPORTANT: For configuring JBoss EAP in Domain mode, we recommend you work with a separate installation of JBoss EAP in a different folder from where you configured and ran the hands-on exercise for the default standalone mode EAP instance. The simplest way to do this is to download the zip archive installation of JBoss EAP, which comes with a fully pre-configured JBoss EAP instance. Simply unarchive the zip file in a folder of your choice other than */opt*, and then follow the instructions in this chapter.

In this exercise, you will set up a JBoss EAP Managed Domain consisting of three servers. One server (`controller.example.com`) will be configured as the `Domain Controller`. The other two servers (`eap1.example.com` and `eap2.example.com`) will be configured to act as `Host Controllers` and will host the actual JBoss EAP server instances split into Server Groups.

=== Pre-requisites

* You will need *three (3)* servers or VMs with JBoss EAP 8.0 installed on them. Your IP addresses maybe different. Replace the values according to your set up.
+
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|*Host*|*IP Address*|*Role*
|`controller.example.com`
|`192.168.124.10`
|`Domain Controller`

|`eap1.example.com`
|`192.168.124.11`
|`Host Controller`

|`eap2.example.com`
|`192.168.124.12`
|`Host Controller`
|===

* Install JBoss EAP 8.0 on all three servers. We recommend using the zip file installation method and installing it in a separate directory to prevent overwriting the configuration of the standalone instance that you have used in previous exercises. For all three VMs, create a user named `jboss` that will run the JBoss EAP instance.

=== Steps

NOTE: Although Red Hat does not recommend editing XML configuration files directly, there are scenarios where it is useful. In this case, to gain an understanding of how a managed domain is configured and the various XML files that are involved. Once the managed domain is set up, you can use either the EAP web console, or the EAP CLI to manage the domain configuration.

. Log in to the VM that you will configure as the `Domain Controller` (*controller*). Log in as the `jboss` user to run the JBoss EAP instance.

. Create the domain administrator management account (`eap-domain-admin`) using the `add-user.sh` script in the `$EAP_HOME/bin`folder.
+
```bash
$ ./add-user.sh -m -u eap-domain-admin -p redhat123
```

. Inspect the default `EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/domain.xml` file. There are 2 `Server Groups` defined in the domai (`main-server-group` and `other-server-group`).
+
[source,xml]
----
<server-groups>
        <server-group name="main-server-group" profile="full">
            <jvm name="default">
                <heap size="1000m" max-size="1000m"/>
            </jvm>
            <socket-binding-group ref="full-sockets"/>
        </server-group>
        <server-group name="other-server-group" profile="full-ha">
            <jvm name="default">
                <heap size="1000m" max-size="1000m"/>
            </jvm>
            <socket-binding-group ref="full-ha-sockets"/>
        </server-group>
</server-groups>
----

. Inspect the default `EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/host-primary.xml` file. This file configures the host as the primary controller (Domain Controller). There are no server definitions in this file. You will configure the `eap1` and `eap2` VMs as host controllers and configure them to point to the domain controller in the next steps. The actual JBoss EAP server instances hosting applications will run on the `eap1` and `eap2` VMs.
+
[source,xml]
----
<domain-controller>
    <local/>
</domain-controller>
----

. Start the domain controller on the `controller` VM.
+
```bash
$ cd $EAP_HOME/bin
$ ./domain.sh --host-config=host-primary.xml -b 192.168.124.10 -bmanagement 192.168.124.10

```
+
Since the secondary host controllers need to communicate with the domain controller to fetch configuration information, you need to start the primary controller to bind to the IP address of the `controller` VM rather than `localhost`. 
+
NOTE: If you do not pass a `--host-config` argument to the `domain.sh` script, it will read the `EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/host.xml` configuration file by default. Similarly, if you do not pass a `-b` flag with a valid IP address for the VM, it will start and bind to `localhost`.

. Log in to the `eap1` VM as the `jboss` user. Inspect the `EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/host-secondary.xml` file. Notice that there are two servers declared. `server-one` belongs to the `main-server-group`, and `server-two` belongs to the `other-server-group`.
+
[source,xml]
----
<servers>
    <server name="server-one" group="main-server-group"/>
    <server name="server-two" group="other-server-group">
        <socket-bindings port-offset="150"/>
    </server>
 </servers>
----
+
NOTE: `server-two` needs to run on a different port to avoid port clashes. In the default configuration, it runs on an offset of `150`. So `server-one` will run on port `8080` (the base port), while `server-two` will run on port `8230` (8080+150).

. Before you start the host controller process on `eap1`, you need to configure a couple of items to ensure that the host controller on `eap1` can communicate with the domain controller running on the `controller` VM. First, add the following `authentication-client` element in the `host-secondary.xml` file on `eap1`. Add this block after the *subsystem xmlns="urn:wildfly:elytron:18.0"* and before the *<providers>* element.
+

----
+
This XML snippet configured an authentication context for the host controller on `eap1` to communicate with the domain controller using the management user `eap-domain-admin` you created earlier on the `controller` VM. Ensure the that the `authentication-name` and `clear-text` values match the username and password of the management user.

. Reference the `authentication-context` in the `domain-controller` element. Notice that, where you added `local` to the domain controller configuration on the `controller` VM, on `eap1` you add a `remote` element and refer to the authentication context you created earlier. Observe the placeholder variables in the `static-discovery` element for the `host`, `protocol`, and `port`. You will pass the IP address of the domain controller as command line flags to the `domain.sh` script.
+

</domain-controller>
----

. On RHEL 9 VMs, for security reasons, only a limited number of ports are opened for access from external users. You need to open port `9990` on the `controller` VM to allow the host controllers to connect. First, verify that port 9990 is not open as the `root` user.
+
```bash
[root@controller ~]# firewall-cmd --list-all
public (active)
...
  interfaces: enp1s0
  sources: 
  services: cockpit dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports: 
  protocols: 
...
```

. Open the `TCP` port `9990` as the `root` user.
+
```bash
[root@controller ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9990/tcp
success
[root@controller ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
```

. Verify that port 9990 is open.
+
```bash
[root@controller ~]# firewall-cmd --list-all
public (active)
...
  interfaces: enp1s0
  sources: 
  services: cockpit dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports: 9990/tcp
  protocols:
...
```
+
WARNING: Failure to configure the firewall properly will result in failures during host controller start up.

. You can now start the host controller on `eap1` as the `jboss` user.
+
```bash
[jboss@eap1 bin]$ ./domain.sh --host-config=host-secondary.xml -Djboss.host.name=eap1 -Djboss.domain.primary.address=192.168.124.10 -b 192.168.124.11 -bmanagement 192.168.124.11

. Switch to the terminal window on the `controller` VM and confirm you see the following, indicating that the domain controller has registered the host controller on `eap1` successfully:
+
```text
... WFLYHC0019: Registered remote secondary host "eap1", JBoss JBoss EAP 8.0.0.GA (WildFly 21.0.5.Final-redhat-00001)
```

. Log in to the `eap2` VM as the `jboss` user. Inspect the EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/host-secondary.xml file. Edit the `servers` section, and rename the existing server configuration under it as per the following:
+
[source,xml]

<servers>
  <server name="server-three" group="main-server-group"/>
    <server name="server-four" group="other-server-group">

</servers>
----
+
`server-three` belongs to the `main-server-group`, and `server-two` belongs to the `other-server-group`. Similar to the configuration on `eap1`, `server-four` runs with a port offset of *150*.

.  Add the following `authentication-client` element in the `host-secondary.xml` file on `eap2`.
