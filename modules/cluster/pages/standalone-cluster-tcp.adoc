= Standalone Mode Clustering (TCP)

By default, the tcp stack also uses multicast to discover other cluster members by using the MPING JGroups protocol. JGroups provides other discovery protocols, such as PING, TCPPING, TCPGOSSSIP, JDBC_PING, FILE_PING, DNS_PING, or KUBE_PING. See the references section to learn more about each discovery protocol.

If you need to avoid multicast communication, then you can customize the tcp stack by changing the discovery protocol to either TCPPING or TCPGOSSIP.

*TCPPING* is a JGroups protocol that uses a static list to define the cluster members, and uses unicast as an alternative to multicast.

The following parameters are specific to this protocol:

* *initial_hosts* - A list of the hosts to look up for cluster membership.
* *port_range* - The range that the protocol uses to search for hosts based on the initial port. For example, a port range of two on an initial port of 7600 results in the TCPPING protocol searching for a viable host on ports 7600 and 7601.
* *TCPGOSSIP* - Discovers members of a cluster by using an external gossip router.

In this section, we focus on TCP based clustering using the TCPPING protocol and a static list of initial hosts that lists the cluster members.

== Exercise: Clustering JBoss EAP 8 instances in Standalone Mode (TCP)

=== Pre-requisites

* For the exercises in this chapter, you will need *two (2)* servers or VMs with JBoss EAP 8.0 installed on them. Your IP addresses maybe different. Replace the values according to your set up.
+
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|*Host*|*IP Address*|*Role*
|`eap1.example.com`
|`192.168.124.11`
|`Cluster Node`

|`eap2.example.com`
|`192.168.124.12`
|`Cluster Node`
|===

* Install JBoss EAP 8.0 on both servers. We recommend using the zip file installation method and installing it in a separate directory to prevent overwriting the configuration of the instance that you have used in previous exercises. For all VMs, create a user named `jboss` that will run the JBoss EAP instance.

WARNING: This chapter and the following chapters involve a lot changes to the XML configuration files in JBoss EAP. We recommend you backup the configuration files after each exercise so that you have a record of your changes.

=== Steps

. You need to open a number of firewall ports on the `eap1` and `eap2` RHEL 9 VMs for clustering to work. Use the script below to configure the firewall. Execute the script/commands as the `root` user:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh

# UDP ports
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=23364/udp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=45688/udp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=45700/udp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=55200/udp

# TCP ports
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=7600/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=54200/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=57600/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8009/tcp

firewall-cmd --reload
----
+
You can verify that the ports are open using the command below:
+
[source,bash]
----
[root@server]# firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public

IMPORTANT: Ensure you run these commands on *BOTH* `eap1` and `eap2` cluster nodes!

. JBoss EAP conveniently provides a number of useful default configuration files for high availability setups. For this exercise, we will use the `standalone-full-ha.xml` configuration file for clustering, high availability and load balancing. Inspect the `jgroups` subsystem in the `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml` file:
+
[source,xml]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:jgroups:9.0">
  <channels default="ee">
    <channel name="ee" stack="udp" cluster="ejb"/>
  </channels>
  <stacks>
    <stack name="udp">
      ...
    </stack>
    <stack name="tcp">
      ...
    </stack>
    </stacks>
</subsystem>
----
+
JBoss EAP uses the *jgroups* subsystem for forming clusters. The jgroups subsystem can work with different types of networks (UDP and TCP) to handle cluster communication. By default, *UDP* is used for cluster communication. 

. Start the `eap1` node as the `jboss` user.
+
```bash
[jboss@eap1 bin] $ ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml \
  -Djboss.bind.address=192.168.124.11 \
  -Djboss.bind.address.private=192.168.124.11 \
  -Djboss.node.name=eap1 \
  -Djboss.messaging.cluster.password=redhat123
```
+
IMPORTANT: Each node of the cluster must have a unique name. Use the `-Djboss.node.name` flag in the command line to pass a unique name. 
+
NOTE: Note that in our environment, we are binding both the `-Djboss.bind.address` and `-Djboss.bind.address.private` values to the same IP address (The IP address of the respective VMs). Ideally, you should use separate network interfaces with different IPs in separate isolated sub-networks.

. Start the `eap2` node as the `jboss` user. Pass the IP address and unique node name of the cluster member as command line flags.
+
```bash
[jboss@eap1 bin] $ ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml\
  -Djboss.bind.address=192.168.124.12 \
  -Djboss.bind.address.private=192.168.124.12 \
  -Djboss.node.name=eap2 \
  -Djboss.messaging.cluster.password=redhat123
```

. To configure clustering using the TCP stack, download and inspect the JBoss EAP CLI file at https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/eap-qc-apps/blob/main/admin2/new-tcp-stack.cli. Copy this file to both `eap1` and `eap2`.
+
```bash
# Define the socket bindings
/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/remote-destination-outbound-socket-binding=jgroups-host-eap1:add(host=192.168.124.11,port=7600)
/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/remote-destination-outbound-socket-binding=jgroups-host-eap2:add(host=192.168.124.12,port=7600)
batch
# Add the tcpping stack
/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping:add
/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping/transport=TCP:add(socket-binding=jgroups-tcp)
/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping/protocol=TCPPING:add(socket-bindings=[jgroups-host-eap1,jgroups-host-eap2])
/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping/protocol=MERGE3:add
/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping/protocol=FD_SOCK:add
/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping/protocol=FD_ALL:add

/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping/protocol=MFC:add
/subsystem=jgroups/stack=tcpping/protocol=FRAG3:add
# Set tcpping as the stack for the ee channel
/subsystem=jgroups/channel=ee:write-attribute(name=stack,value=tcpping)
run-batch
reload
```
+
We create `socket-bindings` for every node in the cluster and give it a unique name, IP address and port number where cluster communication happens. Replace the IP address values as per your environment. We also a new jgroups `TCPPING` stack, that uses the TCP protocol to communicate with cluster members. We finally set the default jgroups stack to the newly created TCPPING stack.

. Execute the `new-tcp-stack.cli` file on *BOTH* `eap1` and `eap2` using the EAP CLI and pass the path to the CLI file.
+
```bash
[jboss@eap1 bin]$ ./jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=/tmp/new-tcp-stack.cli
{"outcome" => "success"}
{"outcome" => "success"}
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
[jboss@eap1 bin]$ :reload
```
+
WARNING: Ensure you execute this script on BOTH `eap1` and `eap2` nodes!

. You can inspect the difference in the `standalone-full-ha.xml` file after you execute this script on both nodes. See https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/eap-qc-apps/blob/main/admin2/tpc-udp.diff.

. Download the sample application to test the cluster from https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/eap-qc-apps/releases/download/eap8-lp/cluster.war. Copy the WAR file to the `/tmp` folder on both `eap1` and `eap2`.
+
```bash
$ scp cluster.war jboss@eap1:/tmp/
$ scp cluster.war jboss@eap2:/tmp/
```

. Launch the JBoss EAP CLI and deploy the WAR file on both `eap1` and `eap2` nodes.
+
```bash
[jboss@eap1 bin]$ ./jboss-cli.sh --connect
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] deploy /tmp/cluster.war --force
```
+
Repeat the same commands to deploy the WAR file on `eap2`.

. Access the test application on `eap1`. Using a web browser, navigate to the public IP of `eap1` (http://192.168.124.11:8080/cluster). You should see the home page of the application. It prints the session ID value along with a simple counter that increments on every page hit. It also shows which node servers the request (This will become relevant when you introduce a load balancer in the next section and split the traffic between the two nodes).
+

. The idea behind clustering is to replicate the HTTP session objects between the cluster nodes. Since there is no load balancer running with _session stickiness_ enabled, we need to test it manually from the command line using the `curl` command and passing the session value as HTTP header (as cookies) values. JBoss EAP creates a unique cookie for every user (called *JSESSIOND*), that it uses to track HTTP sessions. Open the browser's DevTools pane (Ctrl + Shift + C for Chrome, then go to `Application > Cookies > http://192.168.124.11:8080`) and find the *JSESSIONID* cookie value. Right click on the value, select `Edit Value`, and then copy this value to the clipboard. 
+
image::jsession-id-value.png[Grab the JSESSIONID Cookie Value from DevTools]
+
NOTE: You cannot use a browser to test this scenario because there is no way to enable or simulate session stickiness. The browser will create a unique session ID for each of the nodes and you will not be able to visualize the replication and failover.

. Use the `curl` command to send requests to the application and increment the counter. Replace the `Cookie:` value with your own unique *JSESSIONID* value.
+
```bash
$ curl http://192.168.124.11:8080/cluster/cluster \
  --header "Cookie: JSESSIONID=HxM_z7c2tbtHdpzo0JnYkV5jNZWEfHvxrP0-bja-.eap1"
...
<h1>Cluster Demo App</h1>
<p>Session ID: ohWxpNiozUE7xG9q3cGIAmkthrsRdtf8EJrZwntg</p>
<p>Visit Count: 2</p>
<p>I am running on host eap1.example.com (192.168.124.11)</p>
...
```
+
Run this `curl` command a few more times and observe the `Visit Count` value increasing by one for every request.

. The session ID created on `eap1` should have been replicated to all members of the cluster. To verify this behavior, press `Ctrl + C` in the `eap1` terminal window to stop the `eap1` node and eject it from the cluster. Observe the logs in the terminal window on `eap2`. The cluster has noticed that `eap1` is no longer available and it rebalances.
+
```
...
ISPN100001: Node eap1 left the cluster
ISPN100007: After merge (or coordinator change), recovered members [eap2]...
...
```

. Use the `curl` command to send requests to `eap2`. Replace the `Cookie:` value with the same *JSESSIONID* value that you used for sending requests to `eap1`.
+
```bash
$ curl http://192.168.124.12:8080/cluster/cluster \
  --header "Cookie: JSESSIONID=HxM_z7c2tbtHdpzo0JnYkV5jNZWEfHvxrP0-bja-.eap1"
<h1>Cluster Demo App</h1>
<p>Session ID: ZFf88oPFpFjtMX12TEbVuPJCHDpPO4Dcrj9rm4_6</p>
<p>Visit Count: 3</p>
<p>I am running on host eap2.example.com (192.168.124.12)</p>
```

. Observe how the counter value is incremented, and not reset to zero. This is because the counter value (which has been stored in the HTTP session) has been replicated to `eap2`. Send a few more requests and notice the counter value is incremented by 1 for every request.

. Optional: Test failback. First, restart `eap1` and let it join the cluster. Now, kill `eap2` and re-test the cluster application using curl, but this time send requests to `eap1`. Observe that the counter value is not reset, instead it is incremented by one as expected.
