= Clustering and High Availability

This chapter deals with running multiple instances of JBoss EAP 8 and clustering them for high availability and redundancy. It mostly focuses on clustering _standalone_ instances. We also cover load balancing requests between JBoss EAP 8 instances using the _undertow_ reverse proxy.

We primarily focus on clustering in _standalone_ mode in this chapter. The process for clustering instances running in a managed domain is similar (Just ensure to configure port offsets for the instances correctly and ensure the offset ports are allowed to receive traffic by opening the appropriate firewall ports). This configuration is left as an exercise and a challenge to the student.
